    <p>All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Papers must be submitted electronically in DOC format
at easychair. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that
are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers will be peerreviewed and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of
exposition.<br><br>
The submitted papers must be between 4-6 pages. To facilitate the paper’s double-blind peer review
process, authors should make efforts to ensure that information about the authors’ identities do not appear
anywhere in the text-body of the paper and must follow the guidelines.<br><br>
Upon acceptance, at least one of the authors listed in the paper must submit the final paper, attend the
conference and present the paper according to the schedule of the conference. In the event that the presenter
is unable to attend the conference for any reasons, your accepted paper will not be considered for submission
of the proceeding to the IEEE Xplore.<br><br>
Accepted papers after further revisions will be invited for publications in selected journals. Please direct any
questions about the paper submission process to the program chair at ict4m@iium.edu.my.<br><br>
<p><b>No Show Policy</b></p>
Papers that are accepted must be presented at the conference, either by the authors themselves or via a proxy.
In case a paper is not presented at the conference, it shall be deemed a ‘no-show’. Only presented papers
will be submitted for indexing. No refund of the paid fees may be claimed by the ‘no-show’ author.</p>
